Hello, my name is Michael Okoronkwo. I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the University at Buffalo (SUNY).  I grew up in New York and I am technically a [â€œsecond-generation immigrant"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-generation_immigrants_in_the_United_States). 


During my spare time, I enjoy learning about random open-source projects and reading about medicine, public health, geopolitics, and financial news. Any knowledge that I may have on these topics , at best , will cover a broad area but will likely only penetrate the subject matter at a shallow depth. 

My (data) projects and posts may be somewhat related to any one of the topics previously listed. Feel free to explore, I hope you get some enjoyment out of the content on this site.
